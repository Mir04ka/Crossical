## Rules
Each turn a player places his symbol in any unoccupied square of the field (9 by 9).

If a new symbol placed by a player forms a row of three or more identical symbols vertically, horizontally and diagonally, the player captures those squares on the master field (3 by 3) on which these rows fall.

To win you must line up your symbols horizontally, vertically or diagonally.

The cells of the master field can be recaptured.

If a player extends a row of his symbols, the row is considered a new one.
